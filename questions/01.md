# Using .map

Below we have a variable, `nums`, set equal to an array of numbers:

```rb
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Which piece of code enumerate over the array with the `.map` method and return a
new array of the **squares** of those numbers?

## Correct

```rb
nums.map { |n| n * n }
```

> Right! `map` will return a new array with the same length as the original
> array, and each element will be the return value of the block. To calculate
> the square of a number, you multiply it by itself (so two squared is the same
> as two times two).

## Incorrect

```rb
nums.map do |n|
 n + n
end
```

> `map` will return a new array with the same length as the original array, and
> each element will be the return value of the block. To calculate the square of
> a number, you multiply it by itself (so two squared is the same as two times
> two). This would return the result **doubled**, not **squared**.

## Incorrect

```rb
nums.collect { |n| nn }
```

> `map` will return a new array with the same length as the original array, and
> each element will be the return value of the block. In this example, we'd get
> an error since `nn` is not a valid variable name, and it's not the correct
> syntax for multiplying a number by itself.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

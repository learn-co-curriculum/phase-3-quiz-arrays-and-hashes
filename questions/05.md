# Using .include?

We have a variable `famous_cats` set equal to an array of famous cats:

```rb
famous_cats = ["Maru", "Lil Bub", "Grumpy Cat"]
```

How could we use the `.include?` method to check and see if the array
includes the string `"Maru"`?

## Correct

```rb
famous_cats.include?("Maru")
```

> Right! We can call `.include?` on an array, and pass it a value that we want
> to check for in the array.

## Incorrect

```rb
famous_cats.include?
```

> We can call `.include?` on an array, but we need to pass it a value that we
> want to check for in the array.

## Incorrect

```rb
famous_cats.include?(true)
```

> We can call `.include?` on an array, but we need to pass it the value that we
> want to check for in the array, which in our case is `"Maru"`.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

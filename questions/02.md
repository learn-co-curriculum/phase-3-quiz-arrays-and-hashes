# Using .filter

Below we have a variable, `cats_and_dogs`, set equal to an array of strings
that are either a `"cat"` or a `"dog"`:

```rb
cats_and_dogs = ["cat", "cat", "dog", "cat", "dog", "dog"]
```

We all know that cats and dogs don't get along. Which piece of code let us
iterate over the array and return an array of only cats?

## Correct

```rb
cats_and_dogs.filter do |pet|
  pet == "cat"
end
```

> Right! The `filter` method iterates over an array and returns an array of all
> elements for which the block returns true. For the block to return true when
> the `pet` variable is `"cat"`, we just need to use the `==` method to compare
> the strings.

## Incorrect

```rb
cats_and_dogs.filter do |pet|
  pet == "dog"
end
```

> The `filter` method iterates over an array and returns an array of all
> elements for which the block returns true. This would give us an array of all
> `"dog"` strings, not `"cat"` strings.

## Incorrect

```rb
cats_and_dogs.filter do |pet|
  pet == pet
end
```

> The `filter` method iterates over an array and returns an array of all
> elements for which the block returns true. This block would return `true` for
> all pets in the original array, so we'd still end up with cats and dogs
> together.

## Incorrect

```rb
cats_and_dogs.filter do |pet|
  "cat"
end
```

> The `filter` method iterates over an array and returns an array of all
> elements for which the block returns true (or a truthy value). Since strings
> are truthy in Ruby, this would return all pets in the original array, so we'd
> still end up with cats and dogs together.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

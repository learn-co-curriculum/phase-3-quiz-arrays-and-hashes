# Using .filter

We have a variable `odds_and_evens` set equal to an array of numbers:

```rb
odds_and_evens = [1, 3, 0, 2, 18, 5, 10, 24]
```

Which code can we use with the `.filter` enumerator to iterate over the array
and return any even numbers? Select all that apply.

> This requires checking if a number is even. If you're unsure how to do that,
> reference the Ruby Documentation or try a Google search!

## Correct

```rb
odds_and_evens.filter do |n|
  n.even?
end
```

> Right! The `filter` method iterates over an array and returns an array of all
> elements for which the block returns true. For the block to return true when
> the number is even, we can use Ruby's built-in `.even?` method.

## Correct

```rb
odds_and_evens.filter do |n|
  n % 2 == 0
end
```

> Right! The `filter` method iterates over an array and returns an array of all
> elements for which the block returns true. For the block to return true when
> the number is even, we can the `%` (remainder) method to see if the number is
> evenly divisible by two.

## Incorrect

```rb
odds_and_evens.filter do |n|
  n / 2 == 0
end
```

> The `filter` method iterates over an array and returns an array of all
> elements for which the block returns true. Only `0 / 2 == 0` will return true,
> so we'd miss all the other even numbers.

## Incorrect

```rb
odds_and_evens.filter do |n|
  n + 2
end
```

> The `filter` method iterates over an array and returns an array of all
> elements for which the block returns true. Adding 2 to a number will just
> return a new number, and since all numbers in Ruby are truthy, we'll end up

## Incorrect

I don't know.

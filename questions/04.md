# Using .find

We have a variable `odds_and_evens` set equal to an array of numbers:

```rb
odds_and_evens = [2, 3, 2, 18, 5, 10, 24]
```

How can we use the `.find` method to iterate over the array and return only the
_first_ array element that is _odd_?

> This requires checking if a number is odd. If you're unsure how to do that,
> reference the Ruby Documentation or try a Google search!

## Correct

```rb
odds_and_evens.find do |num|
  num.odd?
end
```

> Right! The `find` method iterates over an array and returns the first element
> for which the block returns true. For the block to return true when the number
> is odd, we can use Ruby's built-in `.odd?` method.

## Incorrect

```rb
odds_and_evens.find do |num|
  num.even?
end
```

> The `find` method iterates over an array and returns the first element for
> which the block returns true. For the block to return true when the number is
> odd, we'd want to use Ruby's built-in `.odd?` method, not the `.even?` method.

## Incorrect

```rb
odds_and_evens.find do |num|
  num / 2
end
```

> The `find` method iterates over an array and returns the first element for
> which the block returns true. For the block to return true when the number is
> odd, we'd want to use Ruby's built-in `.odd?` method. Returning the number

## Incorrect

I don't know.
